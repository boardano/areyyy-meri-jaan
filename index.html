    <h1>I Love You ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
    <p>Happy Valentine's day, Meri pyaari mimi</p>
    <div class="book-container">
        <div class="book" id="book">
            <div class="page" id="page1">
                <p>Meri Pyaari, Mimiüíü</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page2">
                <p>So, miss darshini, this‚Äôs our‚Ä¶.<br>
I mean, not our first, though‚Ä¶<br>
Coz, I‚Äôve been in some deep, not able to comprehend, wala love‚Ä¶.<br>
since, the last two valentine‚Äôs day<br>
but, still‚Ä¶<br><br>

let‚Äôs consider this one, as the official one.<br>
And, also‚Ä¶<br>
Thanks for saying, yes, to go on a date, with me.<br><br>

You know, baby‚Ä¶<br>
I‚Äôve played, the moment, where we both get married, in my head, a thousand times (MAYBE, EVEN MORE THAN THAT).<br>
And, I feel like, this valentines day, might be a step ahead towards that, moment.<br><br>

Where, I‚Äôll get to hold your hand, in front of the very parents, family and the society, you‚Äôre afraid of.<br><br>

Today, morning, I just realized, after you hanged up the call.<br>
Words will never be enough, Not for you, Not for this.<br>
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page3">
                <p>Which, makes me a man of action üòâ.<br>
On life, work, love and bed, too üòèüòèüòè.<br><br>

How do I even, begin to explain.<br>
I know, you never used to believe in love and all.<br><br>

Even, I didn‚Äôt too.<br>
When I was a kid, it never made sense, to me, too.<br><br>

Which‚Äôs why, I started reading books.<br>
And, I know, love‚Äôs nothing just a series of chemical reaction in brain.<br>
The dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, mixes and works together<br>
firing, neurotransmitters, everywhere<br>
at the right moment, at the right time, making your heart race, your palm sweat, your pupils dilate‚Ä¶<br>
making guts, ache, everytime, you part ways, from the very person, who made you feel this, way.<br><br>

I know, it‚Äôs evolutionary, designed to ensure survival, to keep us bonded, to make us choose someone and never let go.<br>
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page4">
                <p>But, I don‚Äôt think, that‚Äôs what it all is?<br>
If it was just, just chemicals, just science, then why do I feel you in places my neurons don‚Äôt reach?<br>
Why does my soul recognize you in a way no MRI could ever explain?<br>
Why does my heart, this mere biological pump, ache for you in a way no textbook or book, I‚Äôve ever read, could define.<br><br>

<strong>I love you, like a biologist, does.</strong><br>
Who knows, it‚Äôs all chemicals and neurons, but still, completely struck by an unexplainable factor, of life and nature and divine, stuck with me.<br>
Which‚Äôs love.<br>
Which‚Äôs you.<br>
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page5">
                <p><strong>I love you, like a philosopher, does.</strong><br>
Not just, as vague as a feeling<br>
but, as truth, itself.<br><br>

One that has existed long before us, and will exist long after.<br>
Plato, once said that souls were split in two, wandering the earth in search of their missing half.<br>
And, if that‚Äôs true, babess‚Ä¶<br>
then, you, are my other half<br>
the piece, I never knew was missing, until I found you.<br><br>

Aristotle believed that love is composed of a single soul inhabiting, two bodies.<br>
And sometimes, when I look into your eyes, I swear I see my reflection - not just in the way, I look, but in the way I feel, the way I exist.<br>
Like we intertwined beyond flesh, beyond thought, beyond time, itself, baby.<br><br>

And, I‚Äôve read, Rumi‚Äôs words too:<br>
"The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was.<br>
Lovers don‚Äôt finally meet somewhere,<br>
they‚Äôre in each other, all along."<br>
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page6">
                <p>May be, That‚Äôs why, I‚Äôve loved you, even before I even knew, how it feels to be, around you.<br>
Before seeing you, in person.<br>
Before getting to touch you, feel you, or even be, in the same physical space, as yours.<br>
Coz, even, you, behind a screen, felt like, home.<br>
Like something sacred.<br>
Like, something I cannot and should not, ever be explained, only felt.<br>
A truth, to be felt.<br>
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page7">
                <p><strong>I love you, like a writer does‚Ä¶</strong><br>
with the desperation of someone, trying to capture something too vast, too infinite, too aching to fit, into mere letters on a page<br>

Like, Neruda, once wrote‚Ä¶<br>
‚ÄùI love you, as a certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul‚Äù<br>

Because loving you isn‚Äôt just an emotion, baby<br>
It‚Äôs a quiet force, something that exists, in the spaces, between my words, in the pauses between my breaths, in the silence that still feels full because you are in it‚Ä¶<br>

There‚Äôs a line, which Fitzgerald, said‚Ä¶<br>
‚ÄùI wish, I had done everything on earth with you‚Äù<br>
These words, are the only thought, I carry with your name, in every breath of mine, everyday.<br>
I feel that.<br>
I feel, what he said.<br>
I want to walk, every street<br>
Touch every raindrop<br>
Feel every sunrise, with you<br>

If time, is a book<br>
I want every chapter<br>
Every page<br>
Every word to be about you, with you, for you.<br>

And, I just wanna say, one more thing, as a writer<br>
And, I don‚Äôt want you to stop me, from ever doing that‚Ä¶<br>
As Jane Austen, wrote‚Ä¶<br>

<strong>YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU HOW ARDENTLY I ADMIRE AND LOVE YOU</strong><br>

Because, I am sorry, my love for you is abundant.<br>
I‚Äôm possessed, obsessed and desperate<br>
While, being calm, soothing, peace and at comfort, at the same time<br>
By the love, I have for you.<br>

Sometimes, this love for you, burns<br>
Sometimes, it builds.<br>
Sometimes, rewrites me over and over and over and over and over<br>
Until, I am nothing<br>
but, yours.<br>
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page8">
                <p><strong>I love you as a poet‚Ä¶</strong><br>  
And, I don‚Äôt wanna quote, any poets.<br>  
Coz, I no more have to.<br>  
Coz, I already have the poem, that I‚Äôve been waiting, all my life, to write.<br>  
You‚Äôre the poetry, I‚Äôve always been waiting to write.<br><br>  

But, on this day, of lovers.<br>  
If I‚Äôve to recite a poem, for you.<br>  
I‚Äôd just love to recite, this to you.<br>  
Which, I‚Äôll do, on tomorrow‚Äôs call. üòÖüòÖüòÖ (DON‚ÄôT KNOW, HOW TO ADD IT, NOT SO GOOD AT HTML, DIDN‚ÄôT TAKE, CS IN 12th)
<br><br>  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page9">
                <p><strong>I love you as an officer does‚Ä¶</strong><br>  
May be, I am not, one, right now‚Ä¶.<br>  
But, Hopefully, soon, I‚Äôll be one‚Ä¶<br>  
And, when I stand in that uniform, when the weight of duty and honor rests on my shoulders<br>  
know that beneath all of it, beneath the discipline, the steel, the unwavering spirit<br>  
there is you<br>  
There, is always you.<br><br>  

Because, even when I serve my country, my oath, my people<br>  
I will still, serve you<br>  
I will still, be yours<br>  
All yours.<br><br>  

And, if ever comes a day, when the world demands all of me<br>  
when I am pulled into the line of fire<br>  
when my body is weary<br>  
when my spirit is tested<br>  
Know, that‚Ä¶<br><br>  

I will, always find my way back to you<br>  
Coz, your photo, is always in my purse.<br>  
Showing me the direction to the beautiful eyes.<br>  
To my beautiful eyes<br>  
To my love<br>  
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page" id="page10">
                <p>So, on this day.<br>
I just wanted you to know<br>
I love you<br>
With the fire of a soldier<br>
who completely surrenders to you<br><br>

I love you with the wonder of a biologist‚Ä¶<br>
who understands the science but still marvels at the magic<br><br>

I love with the conviction of a philosopher<br>
with all truth and no lies<br>
coz, you‚Äôre my truth<br><br>

I love you, with the desperation of a writer<br>
who spends his whole life, trying to capture something too vast for words<br><br>

I love you, with the soul of a poet<br>
not because words can define it<br>
but because they, never can<br><br>

Because you are the poetry, I‚Äôve been searching for all my life<br>
the one, I don‚Äôt need to write<br>
because, you exist.
